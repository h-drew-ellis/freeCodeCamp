### <H3 ALIGN="CENTER"> **HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE:** 
If you are coming from [freeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) in search of your answer, simply look at the title of the lesson you are at and find it here in this index. By clicking on the "Part", you will be redirected to the proper JS file where the solutions (trust me, they work... when I posted this at least) are at corresponding to the theme. Each Lesson in the file is seperated with the Lesson count and name in comments. All I ask is, please, try and solve it before hand and use as a last resort and when you do, for the sake of learning, don't cmd + v, cmd + c the answer but type it out. Also if you have read this book of an intro and used this page or any others, please throw this repo a :star:
