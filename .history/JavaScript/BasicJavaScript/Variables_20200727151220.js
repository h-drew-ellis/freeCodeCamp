//Lesson 2:
//Declare JS Variables
var myName;


//Lesson 3:
//Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
var a = 7;
var b = a;
/*The why here:
Variable B has been declared with the value of 2,
however as the js file keeps running it will see that
the value of variable B is called again with the value of
A, which we just declared as a value of 7; thus
variable B now equals A which in turn is 7 instead of 2,
as it was the last value given.*/

//Lesson 4
//Init Vars with assignment operator
var a = 9;

//Lesson 5
//Understanding Uninitialized Variables

// Only change code below this line
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
// Only change code above this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";


//Lesson 6
//Add two numbers with JS
var sume = 10 + 20;
